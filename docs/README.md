Documentation
=============

Diagrams are generated using [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), which is
open-source, free software available for Linux and other operating systems.

Generate diagrams as Scalable Vector Graphics:

    plantuml -tsvg *.plantuml

Without the `-tsvg` flag, it defaults to PNG images.

On Debian-ish Linux such as Ubuntu, use latest .jar from plantuml.com
to avoid minor rendering bugs.
